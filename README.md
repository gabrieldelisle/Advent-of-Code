# Advent of Code

This repo aims to log tries or solutions for problems posted on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), with the constraint of not using any advanced python library: if there is a need for graph or arithmetics, the goal is to implement a solution from scratch to improve my understanding of the algorithms.

To use this code : 
- Log in to advent of code
- Add a `.env` file containing your session cookie
- Run `python -m src.2023.dayx.py`
